# Cammymoop's Advent of Code 2024

I'm going to try doing this one using no "proper" programming
Just neovim, ['vimshell'](https://gitlab.com/Cammymoop/vimshell/), awk, and other command line utilities or bash features

The `working` or `working2` files contain the end state of the vim buffer I used to get the answers. I delete some irrelevant stuff as I go but I don't remove any of the actual steps so you should be able to follow along just by reading the commands and looking at the other working files if necessary

If I use a vim command as part of the process I leave a comment like `#:g/^0$/d`  
Though in that case of that command I probably ran it on a visual selection so it would have actually looked like `:'<,'>g/^0$/d`  
But you get the Idea, hopefully.
